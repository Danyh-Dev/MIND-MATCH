# MIND MATCH

This project was part of the **Network Principles course**. It is a **group project** where we developed an online multiplayer game called **MIND MATCH** using **Java and Sockets**.

## Project Idea
**MIND MATCH** allows multiple players to connect through a **server**. Each playerâ€™s actions are sent to the server and then distributed to all other players. This ensures that all players see updates in **real-time**. The system supports connections over the **Internet**.

## System Components
- **Server:** Handles requests from clients and distributes updates.
- **Client:** A **GUI built with Java Swing** for user interaction.

## Project Outcomes
- A fully functional program with **one server and multiple clients (Server + Clients)**.
- Practical experience with **network communication and multithreading**.
- Improved understanding of designing **real-time interactive systems**.
- This was a **group project**, and I was an **active member of the team**.
